Players in the foreign exchange markets have to use market data to test the performance of changes to their trading strategies. This process is called backtesting. Backtesting environments must consider realistic market scenarios, including so-called aggressive trades. Aggressive trades are defined as buyers buying above the fair market price or sellers selling below that price. Current backtesting environments do not capture the patterns of aggressive trades, resulting in misleading performance evaluation. 

In this thesis, I propose a pipeline to predict when aggressive trades will occur. Predicting trades is difficult in general because trading events are rare in the overall market data. Moreover, aggressive trades add another layer of difficulty due to their complex nature and dependence on market conditions. My two-stage framework tackles these problems: an XGBoost filter handles the rare-event issue, and a neural Hawkes process models the complex dynamics of aggressive trades. 

The results show the model provides a more realistic prediction that captures the complex market behaviors. The predictive ability is beneficial for many market participants and investors to develop better trading strategies and reduce execution costs. The approach can also be applied to other trading environments or industrial systems where rare events influence future sequential behavior. \\[1ex]
