In this chapter, I present the empirical experiments to test the model. The goal is to test our proposed prediction framework in modeling aggressive trades in the FX spot market. In Section~\ref{sec:prediction}, I present the prediction results from the full framework. It includes: first, an XGBoost model is used to reduce the size of the data and find possible aggressive trades; second, a GRU-based neural network encodes temporal market conditions into hidden states, then a Neural Hawkes Process uses these hidden states to estimate the chance of aggressive trades over time. Lastly, Section~\ref{sec:benchmark} compares our model's performance with a benchmark XGBoost classifier without resampling. This shows our approach not only has dynamic prediction ability but also reflects realistic trading behavior in terms of timing, clustering, and statistical distribution.

\section{Prediction Results} \label{sec:prediction}
The prediction framework consists of three sequential stages. The first stage employs an XGBoost model to identify potential aggressive trade timestamps while reducing the overall dataset size. The second stage is GRU networks. It serves as a bridge between machine learning approaches and stochastic processes. It generates hidden states as neural kernels. The final stage implements a neural Hawkes process that estimates event intensity. In the end, this approach produces a detailed and interpretable decision of predictions for aggressive trading events.

% ------------Appendix------------
I present the prediction results of each stage using representative trading days. The training data consists of a whole trading day and the testing data consists of random fragment datasets from different days. In this section, the training dataset consists of the whole trading day from January 31, 2025, 10:00:00 to 15:59:59 PM, containing 307,764 rows. This day is chosen because it contains lots of market information and trade data, which is the most comprehensive trading day across the whole dataset. The testing dataset is 30-minute from February 18, 2025, 13:30:04.710 to 13:59:53.060. 
% More testing datasets which are some 30-minute, 1-hour windows from different trading days and each with around 20,000 rows are displayed in Appendix. 
This specific time window was selected based on the estimated maximum execution time of the MN Algo's.

\subsection{XGBoost Stage: With and Without KMeansSMOTE}

KMeansSMOTE, introduced in Chapter~\ref{chapter:methodology}, is an oversampling technique designed to address class imbalance in training data. I compare the XGBoost prediction results with and without KMeansSMOTE to evaluate the influence of oversampling. The impact of applying this oversampling method on both class balance and prediction quality is analyzed.

I first present the classification results of XGBoost trained with KMeansSMOTE. The KMeansSMOTE configuration is as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
pipeline = Pipeline([
("imputer", SimpleImputer(strategy="median")),
("smote", KMeansSMOTE(random_state=42,
cluster_balance_threshold=0.02,
kmeans_estimator=KMeans(n_clusters=200, random_state=42),
sampling_strategy=0.5))
])
\end{verbatim}

The median strategy fills missing values with the median of each feature. A cluster balance threshold of 0.02 ensures oversampling is done in 'safe' areas where there are at least some genuine minority examples. As a result, the training set has a ratio of 3:7 about class 1 and class 0. It significantly increases the class balance from 1:499 in Figure~\ref{fig: aflag_class_distribution}.

% !!maybe need refinement
This step is aimed to get a model to initially find out as many positives as possible by keeping recall at 0.6 without losing precision. So, the input for testing only depends on market features ($S$, $M$, $V_A^{1}$, $V_A^{1}$, $\bar{\delta}_S$, $\bar{\delta}_M$, $\sigma_S$, $\sigma_M$, $r_V$), and the output contains the shortened training dataset for the next step with aggressive trade candidates. The filtered output also gets rebalanced towards class 1 because I filter out those are not predicted as 1. The bias toward class 0 helps the model learn better from the underrepresented class 1.

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:xgb-pred-vs-true-km}, KM-XGBoost catches many true positives. The class balancing done by KMeansSMOTE reduces the bias toward class 0 and helps the model learn better from the underrepresented class 1.

Table~\ref{tab:xgb-confusion-km} shows the confusion matrix. 4,011 are predicted as class 0 (non-aggressive trade), and 3,739 are predicted as class 1. The model correctly finds 13 true positives and 4,001 true negatives. I exclude those which are not predicted as class 1, so the testing dataset size drops from 7,750 to 3,739 rows, which is 51.75\% of the original. This helps improve speed and keeps most of the important trade points, and makes preparation for prediction in the next neural Hawkes process.

Moreover, Table~\ref{tab:xgb-classification-report-km} shows the detailed classification report. I mainly care about the prediction performance for class 1, since this is the main goal of the whole research. The precision of class 0 is not meaningful here because the original data is extremely imbalanced. Although the precision for class 1 is still very low at 0.0035, the recall reaches 0.5652. This means the model finds sufficient true trades under the model with oversampling. This prepares the input for the next step: the neural Hawkes process.

In Table~\ref{tab:xgb-noKM}, without KMeansSMOTE, even if I reach the same recall, the precision is worse (only 0.0019). This value means almost all predicted class 1 are wrong. The F1-score is just 0.0038, which is only half of the score from XGBoost with KMeansSMOTE. Also, the filter effect is weaker. More lines (5,065) are left in the result, which makes the next detection step slower and more difficult. So using KMeansSMOTE helps not only improve model performance but also makes the pipeline more efficient.

In conclusion, these results show that KMeansSMOTE gives significant improvement when dealing with extreme class imbalance, especially in terms of F1-score. I can also infer from the classification evaluation that a single XGBoost is not enough for the prediction task even with resampling methods. The large set of candidate points predicted at this stage will be passed to the next neural Hawkes model.

In total, 3,739 rows are predicted as class 1, which is 51.75\% of the original test set size of 7,750. This filtered output keeps most of the important aggressive trade candidates and reduces data size for the next step in the neural Hawkes process.}

%------------- Neural Hawkes process -------------
\subsection{Neural Hawkes Process Results}
I use the GRU model to generate hidden states as a neural kernel, which are then used in the Hawkes process. In this stage, I refer to the training process as estimation and testing process as prediction, since it involves fitting a Hawkes process. The estimation (training) is performed on the dataset from January 31, 2025, between 10:00:00 and 15:59:59. This period is the same as the XGBoost training set, but the data is filtered using the XGBoost filter to reduce class imbalance.

In the estimation stage, the GRU is trained as mentioned in Chapter~\ref{chapter:methodology} and hidden states $h_t$ are extracted. For estimation in next Hawkes process, Figure~\ref{fig:train-hidden-state} depicts the hidden states generated from GRU.

In the estimation stage, the GRU is trained as described in Chapter~\ref{chapter:methodology}, and the hidden states $h_t$ are extracted for each time step. These hidden states serve as a compressed representation of the input dynamics and are used as input features for the Hawkes process parameter estimation. The hidden states are transformed using the function $\log(1 + e^{h_k(t)})$ as in Formula~\ref{eq:intensity}. Figure~\ref{fig:train-hidden-state} depicts the hidden states generated from the GRU, separated by class. The top panel shows the hidden state for class 0 (non-aggressive events), while the bottom panel displays the hidden state for class 1 (aggressive events). Compared to class 0, the hidden state for class 1 shows smoother trends and more distinct spikes, which may help the Hawkes process distinguish aggressive event patterns more effectively in the next stage.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{figures/train-hidden-state.png}

    \label{fig:train-hidden-state}
\end{figure}


These hidden states are passed to the Hawkes intensity formula in Equation~\ref{eq:intensity}. I estimate the parameters by minimizing the negative log-likelihood using the L-BFGS-B method. The optimization process was completed in 363.98 seconds, the final negative log-likelihood reached $-8261.28$, and the success flag returned \texttt{True} which means it successfully got convergence. The estimated results are as follows:
\begin{table}[tbp]
    \centering
    \caption{Estimated Parameters of the Neural Hawkes Process}
    \caption*{\textit{Note:} The estimated parameters of the neural Hawkes process. The baseline intensity $\mu$ shows that non-aggressive trades (Type 0) are more likely to occur by default than aggressive trades (Type 1). The excitation matrix $\alpha$ captures how one trade type increases the likelihood of another trade type. Aggressive trades have a strong self-excitation ($\alpha_{1,1} = 2.57$) and also increase the chance of non-aggressive trades ($\alpha_{0,1} = 15.85$). Non-aggressive trades have little effect on aggressive ones ($\alpha_{1,0} = 0.52$). The decay matrix $\beta$ tells us how quickly these effects fade. Aggressive trades have a short but strong influence on others, while non-aggressive trades influence aggressive trades only briefly.}
    \label{tb:hawkes-params}
    \begin{tabular}{lcc}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Parameter} & \textbf{Type 0 (Non-Aggressive)} & \textbf{Type 1 (Aggressive)} \\
    \midrule
    \multicolumn{3}{l}{\textbf{Baseline Intensity} (\( \mu \))} \\

    \quad From Type 1 & 18.48 & 14.76 \\
    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Results of the baseline intensity $\mu$ mean the natural chance of a non-aggressive trade is higher than an aggressive trade without any past event influence. In our case, non-aggressive trades are more likely to occur by default with $\mu_0 = 0.0677$, while aggressive trades are rare ($\mu_1 = 0.0029$) and usually triggered by certain market activity.  Otherwise, it is less easy to happen naturally.

For the excitation matrix $\alpha$, the first column shows how past events of both types excite type 0 (non-aggressive), and the second column shows how they excite type 1 (aggressive). An aggressive trade (type 1) causes a strong self-excitation (2.57), but non-aggressive trade has a much smaller influence on an aggressive one (0.52). Surprisingly, for non-aggressive trade, cross-excitation from aggressive to non-aggressive (15.85) is higher than its self-excitation. This reflects aggressive trade events have significant market influence both to themselves and to non-aggressive trades.

Each value in the decay matrix $\beta$ represents how quickly the effect of a past event of type fades when it influences the intensity of the current type. A non-aggressive trade (type 0) decays with a moderate speed when it influences another non-aggressive trade (\( \beta = 10.55 \)). When an aggressive trade (type 1) influences non-aggressive activity (\( \beta = 18.48 \)), the effect decays faster. Combined with the $\alpha = 15.85$, it suggests that aggressive trade has a short but noticeable impact on non-aggressive trade in the market. On the other hand, a non-aggressive trade has almost no lasting effect on aggressive trades, as shown by the very fast decay rate (\( \beta = 62.32 \)). Lastly, the self-decay for aggressive trades (\( \beta = 14.76 \)) is moderate, meaning aggressive trades cluster, but the effect also wears off gradually.


% ----------------estimated intensity plot------------------
% !!need careful explain of this plot
Figure~\ref{fig:neuralhp-intensity} shows the result of the intensity estimation based on the fitted model and the hidden states from GRU. It is generated by computing the intensity at evenly spaced timestamps over the trading period, and only 1,750 steps are shown here. The model uses the hidden state $h_t$ from GRU at each time point, along with the event history up to that point, to calculate the intensity values. 

The top plot is the sum of intensities $\sum_{m} \lambda_k(t)$ across both event types at every time step. The small purple markers indicate when actual events occurred. The middle plot shows the intensity for type 0 (non-aggressive). It has strong fluctuations and many large peaks. It aligns well with the red event markers. As can be seen in the bottom plot, it is type 1 (aggressive) intensity, which is generally much lower than non-aggressive trade events. Still, many aggressive trade events align with sharp local peaks, meaning the model successfully captures those trades. In conclusion, the estimation results show that the model correctly adjusts the intensity to reflect aggressive trade likelihood.

\end{figure}
\newpage
%------------ prediction -------------
After getting the estimated parameters from the training phase, I test the Neural Hawkes Process on out-of-sample data. The input for prediction comes from the out-of-sample output of the XGBoost classifier. This XGBoost, as discussed before, is designed to contain more aggressive trades by predicting as many positives as possible, helping us balance the class better during prediction. It includes market features such as spread ($S$), mid-price ($M$), volume at best ask and bid ($V_A^1$, $V_B^1$), short-term average changes ($\bar{\delta}_S$, $\bar{\delta}_M$), volatilities ($\sigma_S$, $\sigma_M$), and volume ratio ($r_V$). These can all be fetched directly from the database of exchanges or calculated by these raw data. These features are used to extract hidden states from the GRU, and the corresponding timestamps ($T$) are passed into the Hawkes process to compute event intensities using the previously estimated parameters.

I first conduct a prediction on a sample from 2025-02-18 13:30:04.710 to 2025-02-18 13:59:53.060. The model finally predicts 38 points as aggressive trades. In reality, 23 of them are actual aggressive trades during this time window. It is acceptable because it is more tolerant of false positives than false negatives. The prediction result is in Figure~\ref{fig:nhp-aflag}.

\end{figure}



\subsection{Performance Evaluation}
When it comes to performance evaluation, relying on exact matching metrics like confusion matrix, precision, or recall is not sufficient. In our case, the model predicts 38 aggressive trades while only 23 are truly observed. This difference is expected because the neural Hawkes process simulates events based on the fitted intensity. Its purpose is to capture realistic market patterns, rather than replicate the exact event sequence. In the MN backtesting context, it is more important to match the overall temporal behavior and shape of trading activity than to align precisely with every timestamp. Below, I explain the results of more appropriate evaluation metrics, as summarized in Table~\ref{tb:Evaluation Metrics}.

%----------Temporal Alignment---------
The \textbf{Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)} distance is 23.0, with a normalized DTW value of 0.00297 in Table~\ref{tab:dtw}. This is very low, which shows that the predicted trade activity follows a very similar time pattern as the actual aggressive trades. The alignment path length is 15,464, and the diagonal ratio is 1.995. A ratio close to 2 means the predicted and actual sequences align almost one-to-one. These results confirm that the model learns the shape and rhythm of the trading activity well.
\begin{table}[tbp]
    \centering
    \caption{Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) Results} \label{tab:dtw}
    \caption*{\textit{Note:} The results from DTW. The DTW distance is 23.0, and the normalized distance is 0.00297. This small value means the predicted trades follow a very similar time pattern as the true ones. The diagonal ratio is 1.995. A ratio near 2 means the predicted and actual events align almost one-to-one.}
    \begin{tabular}{lr}
    \toprule
    Metric & Value \\
    \midrule
    DTW Distance & 23.0 \\
    Normalized DTW Distance & 0.00297 \\
    Alignment Path Length & 15,464 \\
    Diagonal Ratio & 1.995 \\
    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The \textbf{Wasserstein distance} is 0.0019 in Table~\ref{tb:wasserstein-results}, and the normalized value is also 0.0019 out of a possible maximum distance of 1.0. This is extremely low. It means that the distribution of predicted event times is almost the same as the real distribution. This is a very strong result, showing that even if the model doesn't predict every individual event correctly, the timing and density of trades over time is very accurate.
\begin{table}[tbp]
    \centering
    \caption{Wasserstein Distance Results}
    \caption*{\textit{Note:} The Wasserstein distance between the predicted and actual distributions of aggressive trade times. The distance is 0.0019, and the normalized value is also 0.0019 out of a maximum of 1.0. This is extremely low, which means the predicted timing and density of trade events are very close to the real ones. Even if the model does not capture every single event, the overall distribution pattern over time is very accurate.}
    \label{tb:wasserstein-results}
    \begin{tabular}{lr}
    \toprule
    Metric & Value \\
    \midrule
    Wasserstein Distance & 0.0019 \\
    Normalized Distance & 0.0019 \\
    Maximum Possible Distance & 1.0000 \\
    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

% For the \textbf{Fréchet distance} in Table~\ref{tb:frechet-results}, the value is 120.98 and the normalized value is 0.4263. This is a higher value compared to DTW or Wasserstein, which suggests that while the general pattern is followed, the paths are not perfectly smooth or identical. Still, it is within an acceptable range for modeling real-world stochastic processes. The model predicts 37 event intervals, while there are 22 in reality, indicating a slight over-generation of events. However, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test p-value is 0.1239, which means the model's event interval distribution is not statistically different from the true one at common significance levels.
% \begin{table}[H]

%     Fréchet Distance (Normalized) & 0.4263 \\
%     Wasserstein Distance (Reference) & 30.99 \\

%     Actual Intervals & 22 \\
%     Predicted Intervals & 37 \\
%     \bottomrule
%     \end{tabular}
% \end{table}

In summary, these metrics show that our model captures the dynamics and timing patterns of aggressive trades well. While not perfect in predicting exact events, the low DTW and Wasserstein distances confirm strong temporal alignment and distributional similarity. This supports the usefulness of our model for predicting trader behavior in backtesting environments.



%-------------------clustering---------------------
To further evaluate the realism of the predicted aggressive trades, I assess the clustering behavior using two statistical tools: the Allan Factor and Ripley's K/L functions. These methods help us understand whether the predicted results have realistic temporal clusters like the reality in the market, or whether they behave more like random noise.

The \textbf{Allan factor} measures event clustering over different time windows. A value of AF greater than 1 indicates clustering, while AF close to 1 suggests a random process. As can be seen in Table~\ref{tb:allan-factor}, for the true aggressive trades ($\bar{\alpha}_\text{true}$), the average Allan Factor is 1.0698. The Allan Factors across different window sizes are as follows: 1.044 for window size 2, 1.044 for window 5, 0.958 for window 10, 1.090 for window 20, and 1.050 for window 50. This suggests consistent clustering in the actual events. For the predicted aggressive trades ($\bar{\alpha}_\text{pred}$), the average Allan Factor is higher, at 1.2687. The Allan Factors at various window sizes are 0.869 at window size 2, 1.290 at window 5, 1.159 at window 10, 1.346 at window 20, and 1.722 at window 50. These values show stronger clustering in the prediction, especially at longer windows. This is reasonable, as the neural Hawkes process is designed to model self-exciting behavior especially.

\begin{table}[tbp]
    \centering
    \caption{Allan Factor Results for Aggressive Trade Clustering}
    \caption*{\textit{Note:} The Allan Factor (AF) values for both true and predicted aggressive trades across different window sizes. An AF greater than 1 indicates clustering. For the true trades ($\bar{\alpha}_\text{true}$), the average AF is 1.0698. The predicted trades ($\bar{\alpha}_\text{pred}$) have a slightly higher average AF of 1.2687. This difference is expected, since the neural Hawkes process models self-exciting behavior.}
    \label{tb:allan-factor}
    \begin{tabular}{lcc}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Window Size} & $\bar{\alpha}_\text{true}$ & $\bar{\alpha}_\text{pred}$\\
    \midrule
    2   & 1.044 & 0.869 \\
    5   & 1.044 & 1.290 \\
    10  & 0.958 & 1.159 \\
    20  & 1.090 & 1.346 \\
    50  & 1.050 & 1.722 \\
    \midrule
    \textbf{Average AF} & 1.0698 & 1.2687 \\
    \textbf{Number of Events} & 23 & 38 \\
    \textbf{Event Rate} & 0.00297 & 0.00490 \\
    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

I also use \textbf{Ripley's K and L functions} to further test clustering. These functions evaluate how events are spread in time. If the \( L(r) \) value is greater than 0, the process is considered clustered; if it is near 0, the process is closer to random. In Table~\ref{tb:ripley-l}, for $\bar{\alpha}_\text{true}$, the number of events is 23, the event intensity is 0.0128 events per second, and the average \( L(r) \) value is 22.76. The values at 1s, 2s, and 5s distances are 12.61, 11.61, and 15.42 respectively. For $\bar{\alpha}_\text{pred}$, the number of events is 38, the intensity is 0.0211 events per second, and the average \( L(r) \) is 31.04. The values at the same distances are 13.96 at 1s, 15.45 at 2s, and 22.42 at 5s. These consistently higher \( L(r) \) values again show stronger clustering in the predicted trades. In Figure~\ref{fig:ripley-kl}, the blue curve corresponds to the actual aggressive trades, while the orange curve shows the predicted trades generated by the neural Hawkes model. I observe that both curves are consistently above the baseline, indicating clustering behavior in both series. The predicted trades closely match the clustering pattern of the actual trades, particularly at shorter distances. This suggests that the model captures the clustering of aggressive trading activity well.

In conclusion, both Allan Factor and Ripley's L function results suggest that the predicted aggressive trades exhibit realistic clustering behavior. While the predicted clustering is slightly stronger than in the true data, this is a natural result of the self-exciting nature of the Hawkes process.

%----------------------ACF--------------------
Next, I analyze the \textbf{autocorrelation} structure of both the actual and predicted aggressive trade series to assess whether the neural Hawkes process model shows the temporal dependence between trades. The Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:acf-pacf}. For the actual aggressive trade series ($\bar{\alpha}_\text{true}$), the lag-1 autocorrelation is 0.0842, showing weak but positive short-term dependence. The values quickly drop near zero at higher lags. For example, lag-5 and lag-10 both are -0.0030. In total, 6 lags are statistically significant, and the Ljung-Box test p-value is essentially zero. This indicates that even though the autocorrelations are small, the actual process does have a significant temporal structure. Next, I test if the temporal structure also exists in our prediction. For the predicted series ($\bar{\alpha}_\text{pred}$), the lag-1 autocorrelation is 0.0744, which is very close to the actual series. Lag-5 and lag-10 values are -0.0049, also similar to the actual values. There are 4 significant lags, and the Ljung-Box test again returns a p-value closing to 0. This indicates the presence of temporal dependence.

These results suggest that the neural Hawkes process produces a time series with similar short-term dependency structure as the actual trader behaviors in the real market. It is fair to say the neural Hawkes process is capable of capturing temporal structure in aggressive trade patterns.

% \textbf{Cross-correlation Analysis:} The cross-correlation between the true and predicted series is also computed. The maximum cross-correlation value is 0.0980, occurring at lag 49. The zero-lag correlation is 0.0301. Although the absolute correlation is small, this shows that the predicted sequence partially aligns with the actual series, especially with a slight time shift.

Higher lag values like lag-5 and lag-10 are close to zero or slightly negative in both cases. In total, 6 lags are significant for the actual series and 4 for the predicted one. The Ljung-Box test p-values are close to 0 in both cases, showing that there is meaningful temporal dependence.}

%----------------Distributional Test-------------

Furthermore, to evaluate how well the predicted aggressive trade events match the statistical distribution of actual trades, I perform distributional tests by the \textbf{Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test}. 
% and the \textbf{Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence}.

The KS test is used to compare the cumulative distributions of two sample sets. It returns a test statistic and a p-value. If the p-value is below 0.05, the distributions are considered significantly different. In our case as shown in Table~\ref{tb:ks-test}, the KS statistic is 0.0019 and the p-value is 1.0000, indicating that there is no statistically significant difference between the predicted and actual event distributions. The actual proportion of aggressive trades is 0.0030, and the predicted proportion is 0.0049. The difference between them is only 0.0019. This result shows that the neural Hawkes model accurately matches the distribution of aggressive trade occurrence over time.

The actual proportion of aggressive trades is 0.0030, and the predicted proportion is 0.0049. Their difference is very small, only 0.0019, meaning the neural Hawkes model successfully captures the statistical distribution of aggressive trade events.}

% KL divergence is a measure of how one probability distribution differs from another. I compute the KL divergence in both directions between the windowed count distributions of the predicted and actual events. 

% The value of KL (actual $\parallel$ predicted) is 7.7609 bits, while KL (predicted $\parallel$ actual) is 2.6656 bits. The symmetric KL divergence is 5.2132 bits. These values are relatively moderate, indicating that the predicted distribution is somewhat more peaked or uneven than the actual one. Still, the predicted distribution resembles the actual distribution well enough for backtesting purposes. Lower KL divergence values generally mean higher similarity, and in our case the distributional shape is captured to a reasonable degree.

%---------Conclusion-----------
Overall, all these metrics, including DTW, Wasserstein distance, Allan factor, Ripley's K and L functions, autocorrelation and KS test confirm that the neural Hawkes process not only models the timing and clustering of events, but also captures the underlying distributional structure of aggressive trade frequency. The Neural Hawkes Process with XGBoost filter and GRU kernel captures realistic and reliable patterns in aggressive trade. It shows interpretable dynamics like short-term excitation, quick decay, and clustering, especially for aggressive trades. This supports our idea that using our framework not only captures overall market features and temporal dependency, but also gives more robustness and control than black-box classifiers.

\section{Benchmark Comparison} \label{sec:benchmark}
In order to show the outperformance of our model, traditional XGBoost is used as a benchmark model. Other settings are the same as in Chapter~\ref{chapter:methodology}, but the KMeansSMOTE resampling method is also removed, so it is a complete basic machine learning tool for classification. I compare the evaluation results between the benchmark (XGBoost) and our model (XGBoost-Enhanced Neural Hawkes). 

Table~\ref{tb:dtw_com} compares Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) results between the benchmark model and our model for aligning predicted and actual aggressive trade patterns. The DTW results show the model gives more accurate timing and better matches the true aggressive trade pattern. The DTW distance drops from 632 to 23 when comparing the benchmark to our model. It means the predicted trades are much closer in time to the real ones. This is a big improvement. The normalized DTW distance also becomes much smaller, going from 0.0815 to 0.0029. Though the diagonal ratio stays about the same in both cases, the model has a slightly lower value. This shows a small improvement in how well the predicted trades match one-to-one with real trades.

    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

In Table~\ref{tb:wasserstein_com}, the Wasserstein distance results also show that the model predicts the timing of aggressive trades much better than the benchmark. The distance drops from 0.1054 to 0.0019, meaning the average time difference between predicted and real aggressive trades is much smaller in the model. The normalized distance shows the same result. This means the model's predictions are much closer to the real timing, while the benchmark is further off.

Both models are compared against the maximum possible distance of 1.0.}

The Allan Factor results in Table~\ref{tb:allan-factor_com} show how clustered the aggressive trades are over different time windows. The true aggressive trade pattern has an average Allan Factor of about 1.0698. It suggests a mild clustering pattern. The model predictions have a slightly higher average of 1.2687, meaning they are a bit more clustered than the reality, but still close. In contrast, the benchmark shows very high clustering, with an average Allan Factor of 4.9571 and especially large values at bigger windows, such as 9.064 at window size 50. This means the benchmark tends to group many predicted trades together in short bursts, which is not realistic. Our model gives a pattern that is much closer to the true market behavior, both in clustering and in how the trades are spaced out over time.

For Ripley's \(L\) function in Table~\ref{tb:ripley-l_com}, our model predicts a slightly stronger clustering pattern, with an average of 31.04. But this is still close to the true pattern and suggests the model captures the clustering behavior well. In contrast, the benchmark has a much higher average \(L(r)\) value of 48.34, and especially large values at larger time windows like 39.46 at 5 seconds. This means the benchmark predicts too much clustering, far more than what happens in the real data.

Table~\ref{tab:acf-series-com} and Figure~\ref{fig:acf-pacf-com} compare the autocorrelation patterns of true, predicted, and benchmark aggressive trade sequences. The benchmark shows a very high lag-1 autocorrelation of 0.7196, which slowly decreases but still remains strong at lag-5 (0.3897) and lag-10 (0.2428). This suggests that the benchmark predictions are highly dependent on their recent past values. The model predictions lie in between the true series and benchmark: they have a lag-1 autocorrelation of 0.1310, which is slightly higher than the true series, but still far below the benchmark.

Table~\ref{tb:ks-test-com} compares the Kolmogorov--Smirnov (KS) test results between the benchmark and the model. The KS statistic for the model is only 0.0019, compared to 0.1054 for the benchmark.

The p-value for the model is 1.0000, meaning there is no significant difference between the predicted and actual distributions. 
In contrast, the benchmark's p-value is 0.0000, indicating a clear mismatch.  The predicted proportion of aggressive trades from the model is 0.0049, which is very close to the actual proportion of 0.0030. Meanwhile, the benchmark predicts 10.84\% of events as aggressive, far from the actual value. The proportion difference is only 0.0019 for the model, but 0.1054 for the benchmark. These results show that the model not only matches the number of aggressive trades more accurately but also better captures their overall distribution over time.
