\section{Backtesting Platform}
% 1. Traditional backtesting using historical order book replay.
% 2. Agent-based market simulations: ABIDES, IABS

\section{Limit Order Book Simulations}

1. Stochastic approaches (Poisson models, Hawkes Processes).

2. Machine learning and AI-based generative models (LSTM, GANs, Diffusion Models, neutral SDEs).

% Andrea (2021) used a CGAN-based agent to simulate order book data in equity domain. They implemented the generator into ABIDES (an open-source trading execution platform) to process execution strategies and test performances.

\section{Comparative Analysis}
% Identify gaps in existing approaches
Most experiments in the paper focus on specific stocks (e.g., Apple, Tesla), but FX market may behave differently.
