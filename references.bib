Since little research has considered how dealers make this trade-off, we empirically investigate how dealers jointly make these decisions in the foreign exchange market using a unique simultaneous equations model. Our model uses an ordered probit model to account for the discrete nature of order aggressiveness and a censored regression model to capture the quantity decision recognizing the clustering of orders at the smallest available quantity, $1 million. Using two currency pairs with very different trading characteristics, we find evidence of a trade-off between order aggressiveness and quantity. We also find a significant role being played by factors related to the levels of information asymmetry and liquidity in the dealers' choices of both the order aggressiveness and quantity.},

Within these periods, we view the limit order book as a Markov queuing system. Indeed, we assume that the intensities of the order ﬂows only depend on the current state of the order book. We establish the limiting behavior of this model and estimate its parameters from market data. Then, in order to design a relevant model for the whole period of interest, we use a stochastic mechanism that allows to switch from one period of constant reference price to another. Beyond enabling to reproduce accurately the behavior of market data, we show that our framework can be very useful for practitioners, notably as a market simulator or as a tool for the transaction cost analysis of complex trading algorithms.},

The model strikes a balance between three desirable features: it can be estimated easily from data, it captures key empirical properties of order book dynamics, and its analytical tractability allows for fast computation of various quantities of interest without resorting to simulation. We describe a simple parameter estimation procedure based on high-frequency observations of the order book and illustrate the results on data from the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Using simple matrix computations and Laplace transform methods, we are able to efficiently compute probabilities of various events, conditional on the state of the order book: an increase in the midprice, execution of an order at the bid before the ask quote moves, and execution of both a buy and a sell order at the best quotes before the price moves. Using high-frequency data, we show that our model can effectively capture the short-term dynamics of a limit order book.

In this paper we derive distributions of transaction prices in limit order markets populated by low frequency traders (humans) before and after the entrance of a high frequency trader (machine). We ﬁnd that the presence of a machine is likely to change the average transaction price, even in the absence of new information. We also ﬁnd that in a market with a high frequency trader, the distribution of transaction prices has more mass around the center and thinner far tails. With a machine, mean intertrade duration decreases in proportion to the increase in the ratio of the human order arrival rates with and without the presence of the machine; trading volume goes up by the same rate. We show that the machine makes positive expected proﬁts by “sniping” out human orders somewhat away from the front of the book. This explains the shape of the transaction price density. In fact, we show that in a special case, the faster humans submit and vary their orders, the more proﬁts the machine makes.},

Some conditions on the parameters are established to ensure the ergodicity of the chain. Moreover, scaling limits are derived for the integrated point process.

We also consider the continuous selling (or ﬂuid) limit when the trading units are ever smaller and the intensity is ever larger. This limit provides an analytical approximation to the value function and the optimal solution. Using techniques from viscosity solutions we show that the discrete state problem and its optimal solution converge to the corresponding quantities in the continuous selling limit uniformly on compacts.},

In a simulation study we illustrate how the model works and highlight its sensitivity with respect to assumptions regarding the collective behavior of market participants. Empirically, we test the model on a LOB snapshot of XETRA, estimate several linearized model speciﬁcations, and conduct in- and out-of-sample forecasts. The in-sample results based on contemporaneous information suggest that our model describes returns very well, resulting in an adjusted R2 of roughly 80\%. In the more realistic setting where only past information enters the model, we observe an adjusted R2 around 15\%. The direction of the next return can be predicted (out-of-sample) with an accuracy above 75\% for time horizons below 10 minutes. On average, we obtain an RM SP E that is 10 times lower than values documented in the literature.},

Developing sophisticated trading algorithms that accurately mimic LOB data is therefore a major topic in this area. In recent times, it has been proven that LOB data often follows non-Markovian dynamics, thus, we believe these models more accurately describe how the LOB would evolve. In this paper, we consider acquisition and liquidation problems for semi-Markov and Hawkes jump-diffusion models. We begin by developing jump-diffusion models to capture these dynamics and then proceed to use diffusion approximations for the jump parts. The optimal solutions to these trading problems are formulated under the stochastic optimal control framework and via numerical methods. Strategy simulations for the acquisition and liquidation problems are considered as well, where we show sample price paths for our price processes, average traded prices, inventory and trading speed paths. This analysis gives a general picture of how one could analyse how these strategies could perform under our more general price processes.},

	abstract = {An extension of the Hawkes process, the Marked Hawkes process distinguishes itself by featuring variable jump size across each event, in contrast to the constant jump size observed in a Hawkes process without marks. While extensive literature has been dedicated to the non-parametric estimation of both the linear and nonlinear Hawkes process, there remains a significant gap in the literature regarding the marked Hawkes process. In response to this, we propose a methodology for estimating the conditional intensity of the marked Hawkes process. We introduce two distinct models: Shallow Neural Hawkes with marks- for Hawkes processes with excitatory kernels and Neural Network for Non-Linear Hawkes with Marksfor non-linear Hawkes processes. Both these approaches take the past arrival times and their corresponding marks as the input to obtain the arrival intensity. This approach is entirely non-parametric, preserving the interpretability associated with the marked Hawkes process. To validate the efficacy of our method, we subject the method to synthetic datasets with known ground truth. Additionally, we apply our method to model cryptocurrency order book data, demonstrating its applicability to real-world scenarios.},

	abstract = {Modern financial exchanges use an electronic limit order book (LOB) to store bid and ask orders for a specific financial asset. As the most fine-grained information depicting the demand and supply of an asset, LOB data is essential in understanding market dynamics. Therefore, realistic LOB simulations offer a valuable methodology for explaining empirical properties of markets. Mainstream simulation models include agent-based models (ABMs) and stochastic models (SMs). However, ABMs tend not to be grounded on real historical data, while SMs tend not to enable dynamic agentinteraction. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel hybrid LOB simulation paradigm characterised by: (1) representing the aggregation of market events’ logic by a neural stochastic background trader that is pre-trained on historical LOB data through a neural point process model; and (2) embedding the background trader in a multi-agent simulation with other trading agents. We instantiate this hybrid NS-ABM model using the ABIDES platform. We first run the background trader in isolation and show that the simulated LOB can recreate a comprehensive list of stylised facts that demonstrate realistic market behaviour. We then introduce a population of ‘trend’ and ‘value’ trading agents, which interact with the background trader. We show that the stylised facts remain and we demonstrate order flow impact and financial herding behaviours that are in accordance with empirical observations of real markets.},

Our model provides a ﬂexible framework for modelling and simulating order book dynamics and studying various scaling limits of discrete order book models.

Unlike the Hawkes case, the intensity ﬁeld is fed into a separate buﬀer, the size of which is the driving intensity of new jumps. In this manner, the intensity loop portrays mutual-excitation of point process events and buﬀer size dynamics. This scenario is directly applicable to the market evolution of limit order books, with buﬀer size being the current number of limit orders and the jumps representing the execution of market orders. We give a branching process representation of the point process and prove that the scaling limit is Brownian motion with explicit volatility.},

	abstract = {Neural SDEs are continuous-time generative models for sequential data. Stateof-the-art performance for irregular time series generation has been previously obtained by training these models adversarially as GANs. However, as typical for GAN architectures, training is notoriously unstable, often suffers from mode collapse, and requires specialised techniques such as weight clipping and gradient penalty to mitigate these issues. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of scoring rules on pathspace based on signature kernels and use them as objective for training Neural SDEs non-adversarially. By showing strict properness of such kernel scores and consistency of the corresponding estimators, we provide existence and uniqueness guarantees for the minimiser. With this formulation, evaluating the generator-discriminator pair amounts to solving a system of linear path-dependent PDEs which allows for memory-efficient adjoint-based backpropagation. Moreover, because the proposed kernel scores are well-defined for paths with values in infinite dimensional spaces of functions, our framework can be easily extended to generate spatiotemporal data. Our procedure permits conditioning on a rich variety of market conditions and significantly outperforms alternative ways of training Neural SDEs on a variety of tasks including the simulation of rough volatility models, the conditional probabilistic forecasts of real-world forex pairs where the conditioning variable is an observed past trajectory, and the mesh-free generation of limit order book dynamics.},

More specifically, this model captures the dynamic relationships between different event types, particularly their long- and short-term interactions, using a Long Short-Term Memory neural network. Using this framework, we construct a midprice process that captures the event-driven behavior of the LOB by simulating highfrequency dynamics like how they appear in real financial markets. The empirical results show that our model captures many of the broader characteristics of the price fluctuations, particularly in terms of their overall volatility. We apply this LOB simulation model within a Deep Reinforcement Learning Market-Making framework, where the trading agent can now complete trade order fills in a manner that closely resembles real-market trade execution. Here, we also compare the results of the simulated model with those from real data, highlighting how the overall performance and the distribution of trade order fills closely align with the same analysis on real data.},

A challenge, however, concerns the robustness of policies validated in simulation because the simulations lack ﬁdelity. In fact, researchers have shown that many market simulation approaches fail to reproduce statistics and stylized facts seen in real markets. As a step towards addressing this we surveyed the literature to collect a set of reference metrics and applied them to real market data and simulation output. Our paper provides a comprehensive catalog of these metrics including mathematical formulations where appropriate. Our results show that there are still signiﬁcant discrepancies between simulated markets and real ones. However, this work serves as a benchmark against which we can measure future improvement.},

In this work, we propose a Recurrent GAN (RGAN) and Recurrent Conditional GAN (RCGAN) to produce realistic real-valued multi-dimensional time series, with an emphasis on their application to medical data. RGANs make use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in the generator and the discriminator. In the case of RCGANs, both of these RNNs are conditioned on auxiliary information. We demonstrate our models in a set of toy datasets, where we show visually and quantitatively (using sample likelihood and maximum mean discrepancy) that they can successfully generate realistic time-series. We also describe novel evaluation methods for GANs, where we generate a synthetic labelled training dataset, and evaluate on a real test set the performance of a model trained on the synthetic data, and vice-versa. We illustrate with these metrics that RCGANs can generate time-series data useful for supervised training, with only minor degradation in performance on real test data. This is demonstrated on digit classiﬁcation from ‘serialised’ MNIST and by training an early warning system on a medical dataset of 17,000 patients from an intensive care unit. We further discuss and analyse the privacy concerns that may arise when using RCGANs to generate realistic synthetic medical time series data, and demonstrate results from differentially private training of the RCGAN.},

    abstract = {This paper presents a model of an order-driven market where fully strategic, symmetrically informed liquidity traders dynamically choose between limit and market orders, trading off execution price and waiting costs. In equilibrium, the bid and ask prices depend only on the numbers of buy and sell orders in the book. The model has a number of empirical predictions: (i) higher trading activity and higher trading competition cause smaller spreads and lower price impact; (ii) market orders lead to a temporary price impact larger than the permanent price impact, therefore to price overshooting; (iii) buy and sell orders can cluster away from the bid-ask spread, generating a hump-shaped order book; (iv) bid and ask prices display a comovement effect: after, e.g., a sell market order moves the bid price down, the ask price also falls, by a smaller amount, so the bid-ask spread widens; (v) when the order book is full, traders may submit quick, or fleeting, limit orders.},

 abstract = {This paper discusses performance measures for market and limit orders. We suggest two measures: one for precommitted traders (who must trade) and another for passive traders (who are indifferent to trading). We compute these measures for a sample of NYSE SuperDOT orders. The results suggest that the limit order placement strategies most commonly used by NYSE SuperDOT traders do in fact perform best. Limit orders placed at or better than the prevailing quote perform better than do market orders, even after imputing a penalty for unexecuted orders, and after taking into account market order price improvement. Unconditional order submission strategies that use SuperDOT to offer liquidity in competition with the specialist do not appear to be profitable.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study how the intertemporal supply/demand of a security affects trading strategy. We develop a general framework for a limit order book market to capture the dynamics of supply/demand. We show that the optimal strategy to execute an order does not depend on the static properties of supply/demand such as bid–ask spread and market depth, it depends on their dynamic properties such as resilience: the speed at which supply/demand recovers to its steady state after a trade. In general, the optimal strategy is quite complex, mixing large and small trades, and can substantially lower execution cost. Large trades remove the existing liquidity to attract new liquidity, while small trades allow the trader to further absorb any incoming liquidity flow.}

abstract = { While the long-ranged correlation of market orders and their impact on prices has been relatively well studied in the literature, the corresponding studies of limit orders and cancellations are scarce. We provide here an empirical study of the cross-correlation between all these different events, and their respective impact on future price changes. We define and extract from the data the ‘bare’ impact these events would have if they were to happen in isolation. For large tick stocks, we show that a model where the bare impact of all events is permanent and non-fluctuating is in good agreement with the data. For small tick stocks, however, bare impacts must contain a history-dependent part, reflecting the internal fluctuations of the order book. We show that this effect can be accurately described by an autoregressive model of the past order flow. This framework allows us to decompose the impact of an event into three parts: an instantaneous jump component, the modification of the future rates of the different events, and the modification of the jump sizes of future events. We compare in detail the present formalism with the temporary impact model that was proposed earlier to describe the impact of market orders when other types of events are not observed. Finally, we extend the model to describe the dynamics of the bid–ask spread. }
